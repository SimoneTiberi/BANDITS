Description: BANDITS is a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differential splicing of genes and transcripts,
  via differential transcript usage (DTU), 
  between two or more conditions.
  The method uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which allows for sample specific proportions
  in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model, and samples the allocation of fragments to the transcripts.
  Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and a DTU test is performed 
  via a multivariate Wald test on the posterior densities for the average relative abundance of transcripts.
